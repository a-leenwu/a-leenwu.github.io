Stat 20 is a large undergraduate course taken by students across many majors. As a course tutor, I spent 8 hours per week assisting the professor at lectures, teaching in self-led office hours and homework parties, answering questions in the online discussion forum, providing feedback on pedagogical methods, and analyzing student data.
