As a Lead Undergraduate Student Instructor, I spend 20 hours per week running a 2-hour lab section consisting of approximately 35 students, answering student questions in office hours, shadowing a course tutor's tutoring section to provide pedagogical mentorship, overseeing the logistics and infrastructure of the 1000-student course, and proctoring and grading exams.

My [section website](https://tinyurl.com/aileendata8sp24) contains resources I put together specifically for my lab sections.
