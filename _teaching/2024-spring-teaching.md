As an Undergraduate Student Instructor, I spent 12 hours per week running two 2-hour lab sections consisting of approximately 35 students each, answering student questions in 3 hours of office hours, shadowing a course tutor's tutoring section to provide pedagogical mentorship, and proctoring and grading exams.

My [section website](https://tinyurl.com/aileendata8sp24) contains resources I put together specifically for my lab sections.
