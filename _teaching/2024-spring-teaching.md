As a teaching assistant, I spend 12 hours per week running two 2-hour lab sections consisting of approximately 35 students each, managing 6-8 lab assistants, answering student questions in 3 hours of office hours, shadowing a course tutor's tutoring section to provide pedagogical mentorship, and proctoring and grading exams.
