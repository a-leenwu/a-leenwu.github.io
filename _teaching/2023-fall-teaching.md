As a course tutor, I spent 8 hours per week running two 1-hour tutoring sections with 5 students each to focus on exam-level practice problems, guiding students through assignments and conceptual ideas in office hours for 2 hours per week, discussing pedagogical best practices with other tutors and TAs, providing feedback on worksheets, proctoring exams, and grading assignments for hundreds of students.
