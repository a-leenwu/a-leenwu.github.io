Hello! Lovely to meet you. ðŸ™‚

I am a recent graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, where I received simultaneous degrees in Data Science and Economics (honours). This summer, I will be joining the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) as a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow.

At Berkeley, I conducted research under Professor [Don Moore](https://learnmoore.org/) and co-authored a paper on whether overconfidence in upward economic mobility undermines support for redistribution. To learn more about my research, visit the [research](https://a-leenwu.github.io/research/) tab.

Beyond research, I have a passion for teaching and mentorship. I was a Lead Undergraduate Student Instructor (uGSI) for Data 8, UC Berkeley's foundational data science course, and I spent 5 semesters out of my time at Berkeley on teaching staff. Read more about my teaching journey [here](https://a-leenwu.github.io/teaching/).

Coming from a social sciences and humanities background, I also love to write and was a News Reporter for The Daily Californian. You can read my news articles [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601083241/https://dailycal.org/author/aileenwu).

Outside of school and work, I have a deep appreciation for nature, and I love to spend whatever free time I have immersed in it. I love to snowboard and have competed at the [collegiate level](https://www.uscsa.org/). When there's no snow, I hike, climb, and go camping.
