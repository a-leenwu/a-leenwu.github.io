Hello! Thanks for visiting. 🙂

I am a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR). Recently, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with degrees in Data Science and Economics.

At Berkeley, I conducted research under Professor [Don Moore](https://learnmoore.org/) and co-authored a paper on whether overconfidence in upward economic mobility undermines support for redistribution. Learn more about my research [here](https://a-leenwu.github.io/research/).

Aside from research, I love to teach. I was a Lead Undergraduate Student Instructor (uGSI) for Data 8, UC Berkeley's foundational data science course, and I spent 5 semesters out of my time at Berkeley on teaching staff.

Beyond academics, I enjoy writing for fun (you can read my news articles in [The Daily Californian](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601083241/https://dailycal.org/author/aileenwu)), and I have a deep appreciation for nature. During my free time, you can find me snowboarding, hiking, or camping.

My CV can be found [here](https://a-leenwu.github.io/files/Aileen_Wu_CV.pdf).
