Hello! Lovely to meet you. ðŸ™‚

I am a third-year Data Science and Economics major at the University of California, Berkeley.

At Berkeley, I am a behavioural economics researcher in the [Moore Accuracy Lab]("https://learnmoore.org/") under Professor Don Moore, where I study whether overconfidence in upward economic mobility undermines support for redistribution. Additionally, I am an Equity in Energy and Environmental Economics Research Fellow in the [UC Berkeley Opportunity Lab and Energy Institute at Haas]("https://www.olab.berkeley.edu/energyinstitute-sloan"), where I am using machine learning and Bayesian modelling to determine optimal locations for future air pollution monitors with a goal of minimizing public health impacts from pollution. To learn more about my research, visit the [research](https://a-leenwu.github.io/research/) tab.

Beyond research, I am a teaching assistant for Data 8, UC Berkeley's foundational data science course. Previously, I was a course tutor for Statistics 20, an equivalent introductory statistics and probability class that teaches R instead of Python. Read more about my teaching [here](https://a-leenwu.github.io/teaching/).

Coming from a social sciences and humanities background, I also love to write and was a News Reporter for The Daily Californian. You can read my news articles [here]("https://dailycal.org/author/aileenwu").

I am passionate about the intersection of technology, social justice, and environmental justiceâ€”from data and AI ethics to creating tools that make the world a better place. I'd love to connect with folks who share the same passions so please reach out if this sounds like you!

Outside of school and work, I have a deep appreciation for nature, and I love to spend whatever free time I have immersed in it. I love to snowboard and have competed at the [collegiate level]("https://www.uscsa.org/"). When there's no snow, I hike, climb, and go camping.
