Hello! Lovely to meet you. ðŸ™‚

I am a rising fourth-year Data Science and Economics major at the University of California, Berkeley. This summer, I am a Forensic Analytics Intern within Deloitte's Risk and Financial Advisory practice in New York City.

At Berkeley, I am a behavioural economics researcher in the [Moore Accuracy Lab](https://learnmoore.org/) under Professor Don Moore, where I study whether overconfidence in upward economic mobility undermines support for redistribution. Previously, I was an Equity in Energy and Environmental Economics Research Fellow in the [UC Berkeley Opportunity Lab and Energy Institute at Haas](https://www.olab.berkeley.edu/energyinstitute-sloan), where I used machine learning and Bayesian modelling to determine optimal locations for future air pollution monitors with a goal of minimizing public health impacts from pollution. To learn more about my research, visit the [research](https://a-leenwu.github.io/research/) tab.

Beyond research, I have a passion for teaching and mentorship. I am a Lead Undergraduate Student Instructor (uGSI) for Data 8, UC Berkeley's foundational data science course. Having worked my way up from Tutor to uGSI, Fall 2024 will be my third semester teaching Data 8. Previously, I was a course tutor for Statistics 20, an equivalent introductory statistics and probability class. Read more about my teaching journey [here](https://a-leenwu.github.io/teaching/).

Coming from a social sciences and humanities background, I also love to write and was a News Reporter for The Daily Californian. You can read my news articles [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601083241/https://dailycal.org/author/aileenwu).

I am passionate about the intersection of technology, social justice, and environmental justiceâ€”from data and AI ethics to creating tools that make the world a better place. I'd love to connect with folks who share the same passions so please reach out if this sounds like you!

Outside of school and work, I have a deep appreciation for nature, and I love to spend whatever free time I have immersed in it. I love to snowboard and have competed at the [collegiate level](https://www.uscsa.org/). When there's no snow, I hike, climb, and go camping.
