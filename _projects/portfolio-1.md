This game generates a random maze of rooms and hallways, and the player's goal is to complete the quest to unlock the door to escape. Players also have the ability to replay their previous game. Using object-oriented programming in Java, we built a graph data structure to randomize the placement of hallways and rooms and stored all the rooms in ArrayLists.
